    "- Ls = 0 (since underground horizontal tank - assume that there is no breathing or standing storage losses because the insulating nature of earth limits the diurnal temperature change\n",

    "- Californian states have similar weather to Durban so will use those weather conditions to approximate and emulate by using the average insulation factor\n",
